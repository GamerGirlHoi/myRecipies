Preheat the oven to 350‚Å∞F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or prepare an ungreased cookie sheet.
Mix all of the ingredients in a small bowl until a cohesive dought forms
Scoop 1" balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet; a teaspoon cookie scoop works well here. Arrange the ball of dough about 1 1/2" to 2" apart
Use a fork to flatten each cookie to about 1/4" thick, making a crosshatch design.
Bake the cookies for 8 - 10 minutes, until they start to turn light golden brown on top. 
Remove cookies from the oven and let cool fro 10 minutes before serving.
